1. Download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
2. Clone your repository
3. Copy all your files to the repository folder
4. Commit and push

**Option B: Using Git Commands**
```bash
# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Initial commit: Military Tag Analyzer"

# Add remote repository (replace with your GitHub URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/military-tag-analyzer.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### **Step 3: Deploy to Railway**

### **Step 4: Configure Environment Variables**

### **Step 5: Get Your Live URL**

1. **Railway will automatically deploy** your app
2. **Wait for deployment to complete** (green checkmark)
3. **Click on your service**
4. **Copy the generated URL** (something like `https://your-app-name.railway.app`)

### **Step 6: Share with Friends!**

**Your app is now live and accessible worldwide!**
